# Ternary Operator Simple
An example of a simple conditional ternary operator in JavaScript. 

The ternary operator is written in the following manner  

## condition ? value if true : value if false


The condition is what is actually being testing. The result of the condition should be true/false.

A ? question mark separates the conditional from the true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true. 

Finally a : colon. If the condition evaluates to false, the code after the colon is executed.
