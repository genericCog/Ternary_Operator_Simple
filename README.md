# Ternary_Operator_Simple
A simple conditional ternary operator in JavaScript. 

The ternary operator is written in the following manner  

condition ? value if true : value if false

The condition is what youâ€™re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.

A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.

Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.
